        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">Last updated: December 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Secure Vault. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your data when you visit our website.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Encryption & Storage</h2>
        <p>Secure Vault operates on a "Zero-Knowledge" architecture:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Side Encryption:</strong> All messages are encrypted on your device using AES-256 before being sent to our database.</li>
            <li><strong>No Plain Text Storage:</strong> We (the administrators) cannot read your messages because we do not possess your password/secret key.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Encrypted strings are stored using SheetDB and Google Sheets APIs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Google AdSense & Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google uses cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website or other websites.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
            <li>Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Log Files</h2>
        <p>Like many other Web sites, Secure Vault makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information.</p>

        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing Secure Vault, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you may not use our service.</p>

        <h2>2. Disclaimer of Liability (Crucial)</h2>
        <p><strong>Use at your own risk.</strong> Secure Vault is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lost Passwords:</strong> We do not store your passwords. If you lose your Secret Key/Password, your data is permanently lost. We cannot recover it for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> While we use industry-standard encryption, we are not liable for any data loss, corruption, or security breaches resulting from user negligence (e.g., sharing your password).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use Secure Vault to store illegal content, hate speech, or copyrighted material. We reserve the right to delete any data that violates these terms.</p>
